# Resource / Move

Move or rename a resource file in the res:// filesystem. Both 'sourcePath' and 'destinationPath' must be res:// file paths. The resource file is moved with DirAccess; its sidecar '.import' metadata (when present) is moved alongside it so the import pipeline stays consistent. The editor filesystem is then rescanned so the new location is indexed. Returns the moved resource's identity at its new path. NOTE: hard-coded res:// path references in OTHER resources are not rewritten — prefer addressing assets by uid where stable references matter.

## How to Call

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/resource-move \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "sourcePath": "string_value",
  "destinationPath": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/resource-move -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)
