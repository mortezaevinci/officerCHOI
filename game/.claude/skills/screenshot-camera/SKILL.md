# Screenshot / Camera

Capture a screenshot from a specific Camera3D (or Camera2D) in the edited scene and return it as a PNG image for direct LLM inspection. Identify the camera with 'nodeRef' (instanceId preferred, else a scene-tree path). The camera's own world is rendered into a temporary off-screen SubViewport at the requested 'width'x'height', so the editor's live selection/camera is left untouched. Output edges are capped to keep the response transportable. NOTE: rendering needs a real GPU — a Godot launched with '--headless' yields an empty image, surfaced here as a structured error rather than a blank PNG.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `nodeRef` | `any` | Yes | Reference to the camera Node (Camera3D or Camera2D) to capture from (instanceId preferred, else scene-tree path). |
| `width` | `integer` | No | Output width in pixels. Default 1920. Must be > 0 and within the dimension cap. |
| `height` | `integer` | No | Output height in pixels. Default 1080. Must be > 0 and within the dimension cap. |
