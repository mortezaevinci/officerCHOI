# Script / Delete

Delete a Godot script file (C# '.cs' or GDScript '.gd') from the res:// filesystem. Fails if no file exists at the path. The script's identity (path, language) is captured BEFORE deletion and returned for confirmation. The file is removed with DirAccess, along with its Godot '.uid' sidecar when present, then the editor filesystem is rescanned and (for a '.cs' file) BOUNDED-settles. WARNING: nodes/resources referencing the deleted script will break — verify with 'script-read' first. Returns a structured ScriptInfo.
