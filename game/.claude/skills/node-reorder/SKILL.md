# Node / Reorder

Move a Node to a different position among its parent's children in the currently edited Godot scene (Godot's Node.MoveChild). Child order is layout order for containers (VBoxContainer/HBoxContainer/GridContainer) and draw order for CanvasItems, and until now it could only be set by creating nodes in the right sequence — rearranging an existing scene had no path short of delete-and-recreate.
'index' is the 0-based destination among the parent's children, excluding internal children; negative counts from the end (-1 = last). Out-of-range values clamp into range. The scene root is refused (it has no siblings inside the scene). Returns the moved Node's updated structured data, whose 'index' is the position it actually ended up at — check it rather than assuming.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-reorder \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "nodeRef": "string_value",
  "index": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-reorder -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-reorder \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{

}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `nodeRef` | `any` | Yes | Reference to the Node to move (instanceId preferred, else scene-tree path). |
| `index` | `integer` | Yes | 0-based destination index among the parent's children. Negative counts from the end (-1 = last). Out-of-range values clamp into range. |
