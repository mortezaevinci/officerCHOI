# Console / Clear Logs

Clear the captured Godot-MCP log cache (read by 'console-get-logs'). Useful for isolating logs to a specific action by clearing the slate first. NOTE: Godot's C# API exposes no managed hook to clear the editor's own Output panel, so (unlike Unity's analog) this clears only the MCP-side cache, not the Godot editor console window.
