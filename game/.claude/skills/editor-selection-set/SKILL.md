name: editor-selection-set
description: Set the Godot editor's node selection to the provided nodes (replacing any current selection). The Godot analog of Unity's 'editor-selection-set'. Each entry is a NodeRef (instanceId preferred, else scene-tree path relative to the edited scene root). All refs must resolve to live scene-tree nodes; otherwise the call throws and the selection is left unchanged. Pass an empty list to clear the selection. Use 'editor-selection-get' to inspect the current selection first. Returns the post-change SelectionData.

# Editor / Selection / Set

Set the Godot editor's node selection to the provided nodes (replacing any current selection). The Godot analog of Unity's 'editor-selection-set'. Each entry is a NodeRef (instanceId preferred, else scene-tree path relative to the edited scene root). All refs must resolve to live scene-tree nodes; otherwise the call throws and the selection is left unchanged. Pass an empty list to clear the selection. Use 'editor-selection-get' to inspect the current selection first. Returns the post-change SelectionData.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/editor-selection-set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "select": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/editor-selection-set -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/editor-selection-set \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "select": "string_value"
}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `select` | `any` | Yes | Nodes to select, each identified by instanceId (preferred) or scene-tree path. An empty list clears the selection. |
