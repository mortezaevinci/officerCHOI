# Node / Find

Find a Node in the currently edited Godot scene by instance id or scene-tree path and return its structured data (instanceId, name, path, type, attached script, child count). Provide a 'nodeRef' identifying the Node (instanceId is preferred; a path like '/root/Main/Player' or 'Main/Player' is resolved relative to the edited scene root). Set 'hierarchyDepth' > 0 to include children: 1 = direct children, 2 = grandchildren, etc. A node that cannot be resolved (bad ref, no edited scene, path not found) yields a structured error, not a null result.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-find \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "nodeRef": "string_value",
  "hierarchyDepth": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-find -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-find \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "nodeRef": "string_value",
  "hierarchyDepth": 0
}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `nodeRef` | `any` | Yes | Reference to the Node to find (instanceId preferred, else scene-tree path). |
| `hierarchyDepth` | `integer` | No | Depth of children to include. 0 = the target Node only; 1 = one layer of children; etc. |
