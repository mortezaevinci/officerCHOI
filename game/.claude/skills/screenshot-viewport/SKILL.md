# Screenshot / Editor Viewport

Capture the Godot editor's main viewport (the 3D or 2D editing surface) and return it as a PNG image for direct LLM inspection. Set 'mode' to '3d' (default) for the 3D editor viewport or '2d' for the 2D editor viewport. The longest output edge is capped to keep the response transportable; oversized captures are scaled down (aspect preserved). NOTE: the viewport must have a live GPU render — a Godot launched with '--headless' has no rendering device and yields an empty image, which surfaces here as a structured error rather than a blank PNG.
