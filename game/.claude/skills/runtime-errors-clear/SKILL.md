# Runtime Errors / Clear

Clear the captured in-game runtime-error buffer (read by 'runtime-errors-get'). Useful for isolating errors to a specific in-game action by clearing the slate first, then performing the action, then polling 'runtime-errors-get'. NOTE: the monotonic sequence counter is NOT reset, so a 'sinceSequence' poll from before the clear still behaves correctly (no old rows reappear). A no-op when runtime error capture is not enabled in this game.
