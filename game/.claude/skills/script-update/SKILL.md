# Script / Update

Overwrite an EXISTING Godot script file (C# '.cs' or GDScript '.gd') under res:// with the provided source. Fails if no file exists at the path — use 'script-create' to create one. GDScript content is syntax-validated before write (invalid '.gd' is rejected and the existing file is left untouched); C# is accepted as-is (no in-editor compiler) and the post-write build settle surfaces compile errors. For a '.cs' file the editor filesystem reimports and BOUNDED-settles before returning (a project rebuild then loads the changed type); a '.gd' file only needs a filesystem update so the editor re-parses it. Use 'script-read' to inspect the current content first. Returns a structured ScriptInfo.
