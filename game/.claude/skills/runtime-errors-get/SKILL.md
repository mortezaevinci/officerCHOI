# Runtime Errors / Get

Retrieve errors raised inside the RUNNING game — GDScript runtime errors, push_error/push_warning, shader errors (Godot 4.5+ engine hook), and C# unhandled / unobserved-Task exceptions (with full managed stack traces). This is the in-game counterpart to 'console-get-logs' / 'script-validate' (which are editor-side): it lets an agent driving a live game detect real gameplay/runtime bugs instead of assuming the game is healthy because the editor console is quiet.
Poll loop: pass the 'highestSequence' from the previous call as 'sinceSequence' to get ONLY newer errors. Start with sinceSequence=0 (default) for everything captured so far.
Inputs:
  - 'sinceSequence' (default 0): return only errors with a sequence number greater than this.
  - 'maxEntries' (default 100, min 1): cap the returned page (newest kept; 'truncated' flags a cap).
Result (RuntimeErrorsResult): 'available' (false when the game did not enable runtime error capture — then an empty list proves nothing), 'ok' (no error-severity entries), the 'errors' [{ sequence, message, type, source, file, line, function, stackTrace, frames, timestamp }] oldest-first, counts, 'highestSequence' (poll with it next), and a 'truncated' flag. On Godot 4.5+ a GDScript runtime error also carries 'frames' (the deep multi-frame call stack, innermost-first, each { function, file, line }) and a formatted 'stackTrace'.
SECURITY: messages and stack traces are forwarded verbatim and may contain sensitive runtime data (absolute filesystem paths, machine/user names, or a secret that appeared in an exception). Capture is OFF by default and the developer must enable it via WithRuntimeErrorCapture(); enable it only on a trusted loopback + token connection.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

  "maxEntries": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/runtime-errors-get -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/runtime-errors-get \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "sinceSequence": 0,
  "maxEntries": 0
}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sinceSequence` | `integer` | No | Return only errors with a sequence number greater than this. Pass the previous result's 'highestSequence' to poll only new errors. Default 0 (all captured). |
| `maxEntries` | `integer` | No | Maximum number of errors to return. Minimum 1, default 100. Newest kept when capped. |
