# Scene / Get Data

Get the scene-tree of the currently edited Godot scene as a structured Node hierarchy rooted at the scene's root Node. 'hierarchyDepth' bounds how deep the tree is walked: 0 = the root only, 1 = root + direct children, etc.; -1 walks the entire tree. Each entry carries the Node's instanceId, name, path, type, attached script, and child count.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/scene-get-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "hierarchyDepth": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/scene-get-data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/scene-get-data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "hierarchyDepth": 0
}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `hierarchyDepth` | `integer` | No | Depth of the scene tree to include. 0 = root only; N > 0 = N layers of children; -1 = the entire tree. |

### Input JSON Schema

  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "hierarchyDepth": {
      "type": "integer",
      "description": "Depth of the scene tree to include. 0 = root only; N > 0 = N layers of children; -1 = the entire tree."
