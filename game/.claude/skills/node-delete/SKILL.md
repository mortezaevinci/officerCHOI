description: Delete a Node (and all of its children) from the currently edited Godot scene. Identify the Node with 'nodeRef'. The Node is removed from its parent and freed immediately (synchronous free, required for editor-mode edits). Returns the deleted Node's identity (instanceId, name, path) for confirmation.

# Node / Delete

Delete a Node (and all of its children) from the currently edited Godot scene. Identify the Node with 'nodeRef'. The Node is removed from its parent and freed immediately (synchronous free, required for editor-mode edits). Returns the deleted Node's identity (instanceId, name, path) for confirmation.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-delete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "nodeRef": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-delete -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/node-delete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "nodeRef": "string_value"
}'
```

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `nodeRef` | `any` | Yes | Reference to the Node to delete (instanceId preferred, else scene-tree path). |
