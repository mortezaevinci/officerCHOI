# Editor / Selection / Get

Get the current node selection in the Godot editor as structured data: the selected scene-tree nodes (each as NodeData with instanceId/name/path/type) and the active (last-selected) node. The Godot analog of Unity's 'editor-selection-get'. Use 'editor-selection-set' to change the selection. Returns an empty selection (count 0, activeNode null) when nothing is selected.

## How to Call
