# Console / Get Logs

Retrieve captured Godot-MCP editor log lines, newest-first. The Godot analog of Unity's 'console-get-logs'. NOTE: Godot's C# API exposes no global log hook, so this returns the plugin's own captured editor activity (not the entire Godot editor console) — including its connection lifecycle diagnostics (connect/disconnect, drain-timeout, config save/load, skill-gen, dev-control, dispatcher, and runtime-capture warnings).
SCOPE WARNING: this is the EDITOR process only. Godot runs a play-session started with 'editor-application-set-state' as a SEPARATE OS process, and no editor API exposes that child's stdout or the editor Output panel to a plugin — so the running game's GD.Print output will NEVER appear here, and an empty result is NOT evidence that the game printed nothing. A running game's print output is not readable through ANY tool today. The closest available channel covers ERRORS only: have the game initialize the in-game runtime (GodotMcpRuntime.Initialize(b => b.WithRuntimeErrorCapture()).Build() + Connect()) and read 'runtime-errors-get'.
Inputs:
  - 'maxEntries' (default 100, min 1): caps the returned array (most-recent lines kept).
  - 'logTypeFilter' (default null = all): restrict to Log / Warning / Error.
  - 'includeStackTrace' (default false): include stack-trace strings.
  - 'lastMinutes' (default 0 = all): only lines captured in the last N minutes.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/console-get-logs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "maxEntries": 0,
  "logTypeFilter": "string_value",
  "includeStackTrace": false,
  "lastMinutes": 0
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/console-get-logs -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/tools/console-get-logs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "maxEntries": 0,
  "logTypeFilter": "string_value",
  "includeStackTrace": false,
  "lastMinutes": 0
}'
```
