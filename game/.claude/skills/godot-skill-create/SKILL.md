# Skill (Tool) / Create

Create a new skill (MCP tool) using C# code. The code is written to a '.cs' file under res:// and compiled into the project assembly by Godot; the tool becomes callable after the project is REBUILT (Godot builds C# out-of-band — there is no automatic reload like Unity's). An existing file at the path is overwritten.

The file must declare a partial class decorated with [AiToolType]; each tool method must carry [AiTool("<tool-name>", ...)] and [Description]. All Godot API calls must be marshalled onto the editor main thread via com.IvanMurzak.ReflectorNet.Utils.MainThread.Instance.Run(), and editor-only code (EditorInterface / EditorPlugin / EditorFileSystem) must be wrapped in #if TOOLS so it is stripped from an exported game build. Return a data model for structured output, or void for side-effect-only operations.

The CONSUMER project's .csproj must already declare the addon's NuGet package references (com.IvanMurzak.ReflectorNet, com.IvanMurzak.McpPlugin) — without them the whole project assembly fails to compile.

Create a new skill (MCP tool) for the Godot Editor by writing a C# (`.cs`) file into the project. Godot compiles every `.cs` under the project into ONE assembly, so after the project is rebuilt the new tool is discovered by the addon's assembly scanner and becomes callable through MCP.

## Inputs

- `path` — `res://` path of the C# file to write, e.g. `res://Skills/Tool_Sample.cs`. Must be a `res://` FILE path ending in `.cs`, with no `..` segment. GDScript (`.gd`) is rejected: only C# can carry the `[AiToolType]`/`[AiTool]` attributes the scanner discovers.
- `code` — the full C# source for the tool file.

## Behavior

Missing parent directories are created, an existing file at `path` is OVERWRITTEN (the re-emit-after-a-fix loop), the file is reimported through the editor filesystem, and the tool bounded-waits for the scan to settle before returning a structured `ScriptInfo`.

**Rebuild required.** Godot builds C# out-of-band (on editor focus, or an explicit *Build*), so the new tool is NOT callable the instant this returns — unlike Unity, there is no automatic domain reload. Trigger a build, then re-list the tools.

## Requirements for the file to compile

The CONSUMER project's `.csproj` must already declare the same NuGet `PackageReference`s the addon depends on (`com.IvanMurzak.ReflectorNet`, `com.IvanMurzak.McpPlugin`) — the addon ships as source, so its own csproj does not carry into the project. If they are missing, the whole project assembly fails to compile, not just the new file.

## Full sample

```csharp
// This sample drives EditorInterface, so the WHOLE file is guarded: `TOOLS` is defined only
// in the editor build, and Godot compiles every .cs in the project into ONE assembly — so
// without this guard an exported game build fails to compile (see 'Guard editor-only code'
// below). A tool that touches no editor API needs no guard.
#if TOOLS
#nullable enable

using System.ComponentModel;
using com.IvanMurzak.McpPlugin;
using com.IvanMurzak.ReflectorNet.Utils;
using Godot;

namespace com.IvanMurzak.Godot.MCP.Tools
{
    [AiToolType]
    public partial class Tool_Sample
    {
        public const string SampleRenameToolId = "sample-rename";

        [AiTool(SampleRenameToolId, Title = "Sample / Rename")]
        [Description("Renames a node in the currently edited scene.")]
        public string Rename
        (
            [Description("Node path of the node to rename, e.g. '/root/Main/Player'.")]
            string nodePath,
            [Description("New name to assign.")]
            string newName
        )
        {
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(newName))
                throw new ArgumentException("New name cannot be null or empty.", nameof(newName));

            return MainThread.Instance.Run(() =>
            {
                var root = EditorInterface.Singleton.GetEditedSceneRoot()
                    ?? throw new InvalidOperationException("No scene is currently open in the editor.");

                var node = root.GetNodeOrNull(nodePath)
                    ?? throw new ArgumentException($"Node '{nodePath}' not found.", nameof(nodePath));

                node.Name = newName;
                return $"Renamed to '{newName}'.";
            });
        }
    }
}
#endif
```

## Suggestions

### Always marshal Godot API calls onto the main thread
Tool handlers run on a background SignalR thread. EVERY touch of a `Node`, `Resource`, `SceneTree`, or `EditorInterface` must go through `MainThread.Instance.Run(() => { ... })` (`com.IvanMurzak.ReflectorNet.Utils.MainThread`) — off-thread access crashes the editor rather than throwing.

### Guard editor-only code with `#if TOOLS`
A tool that touches `EditorInterface`/`EditorPlugin`/`EditorFileSystem` must be wrapped in `#if TOOLS ... #endif` so it is stripped from an exported game build (where those APIs do not exist). A tool that only needs pure-managed state (like `ping`) should stay unguarded.

### Return structured data, not formatted strings
Prefer returning a data model (ReflectorNet serializes it for the client) over hand-formatted text, so the AI can read individual fields. Return `void` for side-effect-only operations.

### Validate inputs first and throw clearly
Validate required parameters at the top of the method, before any Godot API call, and throw `ArgumentException`/`InvalidOperationException` with a message that tells the AI how to self-correct.

### Follow the addon's file conventions
One `[AiToolType] partial class Tool_<Family>` per family, one tool method per partial-class file (`Tool_<Family>.<Method>.cs`), a `public const string <Name>ToolId` per tool, the Apache-2.0 header at the top of every file, `#nullable enable`, Allman braces, and 4-space indentation.

## How to Call

### HTTP API (Direct Tool Execution)

Execute this tool directly via the MCP Plugin HTTP API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/system-tools/godot-skill-create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
  "path": "string_value",
  "code": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input (multi-line strings, code), save the JSON to a file and use `-d @args.json`.
>
> Or pipe via stdin:
> ```bash
> curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/system-tools/godot-skill-create -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @- <<'EOF'
> {"param": "value"}
> EOF
> ```

#### With Authorization (if required)

```bash
curl -X POST https://ai-game.dev/mcp/api/system-tools/godot-skill-create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
  "path": "string_value",
  "code": "string_value"
}'
```
